### Getting started:

#### Planning, wireframes, ERD, and user stories are on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vQ7wqLNI/p2)


You can login using Google and create lists. To add items to a list you can click on the list you want to add to, then add items on the list details page. Everything is automatically saved and tied to only your account.

#### Launch the app and get listing [here](https://sophie-project-two.herokuapp.com/)

### Planned future enhancements:
- Add ability to rate importance of an item from 1-5 stars.

- Add ability to see the 'purchased' items from any given list on another view.

- Add ability to make book specific lists (have a slightly different input to add, including author and title).

- Make designs responsive.
